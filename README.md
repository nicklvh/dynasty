### dynasty development


**`what we have planned:`**

* *custom bots* (custom commands, mod logs, audit logs, etc)
* *advertising bot* (sends a message to a multitude of discord channels every so hours)
* *ticket bot* (allows you to open tickets, made for 1 server)

---

**`now, the prices:`**

* *custom bots* (well obviously, gonna be discussed in the ticket!!)
* *advertising bot* (gonna be a monthly service, most likely $5 - $8 / month)
* *ticket bot* (again, a monthly service, $3 - $5)

^^ these bots can change in price

**`what you will get!!`**

for **buying the product**, you won't get much. you will get a config.json to fill out which is simple (takes 1-2 minutes) and we will help you through it.  
^^ our services are hosted on our end, with **24/7** uptime and **amazing latency** to the discord servers and any downtime (rare) will be accounted for in your monthly bill.

for **buying the source**, you will get the full *source*, and you will be told how to compile, and run the bot.  
**buying the source** will be expensive but you get freedom of whatever you wanna do with your bot.

if you want the source *and* hosting from us, it'll be **$2** a month.
